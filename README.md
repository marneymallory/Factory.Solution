## Description

Project Description.

## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to run and interact with the console app
- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone {clone link}`
2. Navigate to the `{Template.Solution}` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To setup a SQL database using MySQL:
   - Create an `appsettings.json` file in the `{WeekFourTemplate}` directory
   - Copy the text box below and paste into the `appsettings.json` file, replacing `<password>` with your MySQL password:
   ```
     {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=tiffany_greathead;uid=root;pwd=<password>;"
         }
     }
   ```
   - Open your terminal and run the command: `mysql -uroot -p<mysql_password>` (replace `<mysql_password>` with your MySQL password) and select the enter key to launch MySQL servers
5. To run the console app:
   - Navigate to `{Template.Solution/WeekFourTemplate}` in your command line
   - Run the commands:
     - `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `{Template.csproj}`
     - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
     - `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
     - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
     - `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
     - `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` to install EF Core tools
     - `dotnet ef migrations add Initial` and `dotnet ef database update`
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app
6. Visit the application via web browser at: `localhost:5000/`
